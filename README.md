# Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform


Peddy is an innovative platform aimed at simplifying the pet adoption process by connecting pet seekers with shelters, rescues, and individuals who are offering animals for adoption. This web-based and mobile-friendly solution focuses on creating an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to find pets based on their preferences, location, and other criteria, while providing a central place for shelters and individuals to manage adoption profiles.




##  5 Key Features of the Project

1. User Profiles:

Pet Seekers: Can create personal accounts to track their favorite pets, manage adoption applications, and receive notifications on new pets matching their preferences.
Shelters/Rescues: Manage available pets, adoption applications, and communicate directly with potential adopters.

2. Adoption Process:

An intuitive process to help users apply for adoption directly through the platform.
Automated status updates and communication channels for both the pet seeker and shelter.

Detailed descriptions of pets including photos, temperament, medical history, and adoption requirements.
Profiles include shelter contact information or direct chat options.

3. Mobile Compatibility:

Responsive design for both web and mobile usage, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

4. Pet Profiles:

Detailed descriptions of pets including photos, temperament, medical history, and adoption requirements.
Profiles include shelter contact information or direct chat options.

5. Detailed Pet Profiles:
Each pet has a comprehensive profile with photos, temperament details, medical history, and adoption requirements, providing adopters with all the information they need.


## ES6 Features

1. Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind the context of this, which is helpful in callbacks and event handlers.

2. Template Literals:
Template literals allow the use of embedded expressions, making it easier to construct dynamic strings, such as rendering pet profiles or notifications.

3. Destructuring Assignment:
Destructuring simplifies the extraction of properties from objects or arrays, often used in managing API responses or state.

4. Promises & Async/Await:
Promises handle asynchronous operations like API calls (e.g., fetching pet data), while async/await syntax simplifies promise chaining and makes the code more readable.

5. Modules (import/export):
ES6 modules allow you to organize code into reusable components. You can export and import modules, making it easier to manage separate functionality (e.g., services, utilities).
